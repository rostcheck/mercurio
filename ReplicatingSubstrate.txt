A replicating substrate is a substrate that is connencted to an external
channel. When changes are made to the substrate, it will post messages to
the channel. When messages are received from the channel, it will make
changes to the local version of the substrate.

Configuring a replicating substrate requires giving it enough configuration
information to allow it to communicate with the channel.
