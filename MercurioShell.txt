Design thoughts on the Mercurio Shell:

The shell is intended to be a command-line interface to Mercurio. 

Its general command syntax should follow the Windows PowerShell model, including its command-object
syntax, under the thinking that PowerShell is the most modern major shell and draws heavily from 
successful Unix shell models, and with the expectation that as .NET becomes a major cross-platform 
open-source framework, PowerShell will follow. 

Input and output must be redirectable, to facilitate building unit tests.

Adding audio events would improve the shell user experience.
