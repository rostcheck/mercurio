Mercurio stores data onto a abstraction called a Storage Substrate, which can be implemented 
on disk, memory, or via network, and may store its data in a complex manner. The Substrate
contains the physically serialized Mercurio Containers. 

A Container is essentially a private filesystem. It contains a public metadata section, 
a private metadata section, a directory section, and a data section. All sections other than 
the public metadata are encrypted.

The public metadata section contains the fingerprint of the key required to recover the Container 
data and the offset to the private data section.  

The private metadata contains the container name, description, and offsets to the other sections.

The directory section contains a list of the Documents in the Container, with their offsets.

The data section contains all the serialized Documents.


Each Container is serialized according
to the instructions in a Storage Plan, which can be specific to that Container. The Storage 
Plan provides instructions for how to recover the Container Info, Document Directory and 
Documents from the Container. Data in a Container is normally encrypted.

Storage Plans are stored in the Storage Plan Cache and are considered Secrets, because without
a Storage Plan you cannot recover the data in a Container.
